The goal is to scrape data from this website https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways and analyse the customer reviews. Also a classification model should be built to predict their behavior. 


I used webscrapping techniques on the data scrapped from the website and performed data cleaning on it. I used VADER libarary to perform sentiment analysis on it to sort positive and negative reviews. I also built a classification model to predict customer buying behavior from which I was able to infer various crucial insights about their customer behavior and prepared a PPT to explain it.
